# Boox Book [App](#)

### Novel reader for LNReader plugins
A personal fork of [Tsundoku](https://github.com/tsundoku-otaku/tsundoku), built around the LNReader plugin ecosystem.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Boox Book does not support Kotlin extensions.** Nothing built against `tachiyomix` will load — not
> Tachiyomi's, not Mihon's, not Tsundoku's. The only content sources are **LNReader plugins**.
>
> So yes: this is a fork of a fork of Tachiyomi that cannot run a single Tachiyomi extension. Funny, isn't it.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a personal fork, made for my own use. It is not a community project and is not recommended for production
> use. Expect breaking changes without notice.

> [!NOTE]  
> This fork uses AI slop.

## Download

[![Boox Book Stable](https://img.shields.io/github/release/Yuneko-dev/Nekori.svg?maxAge=3600&label=Stable&labelColor=06599d&color=043b69)](https://github.com/Yuneko-dev/Nekori/releases/latest)

*Requires Android 8.0 or higher.*

Boox Book installs alongside Tsundoku rather than upgrading it — the application id is `com.hongducdev.booxbook`. Moving your
library across is a backup and a restore.

## Features

Most of this comes from Tsundoku and, before it, Mihon. Boox Book keeps it rather than rebuilds it — the list below is
what the app does, not what this fork added. For the fork's own changes, see
[NEKORI_CHANGELOG.md](./NEKORI_CHANGELOG.md).

<div align="left">

**Sources**

* LNReader plugins, run by a headless React Native + Hermes runtime, against standard `fetch`.
* Plugins share the app's user agent and cookie jar, so logins and Cloudflare clearances carry over.
* Install, update and remove plugins from repositories, with plugin details and install state.
* Local reading of content, including EPUB, TXT and HTML.

**Reader**

* Paged and volume novel navigation, a chapter drawer, native find in page, and a font preview in settings.
* Configurable reading margins, volume-key scroll distance and WebView network handling.

**Translation and AI**

* Multiple AI providers, per-provider models, custom headers and user guidelines.
* A separate engine per purpose — chapter text, entry metadata and browse titles can each use a different one.
* Chapter chunking by word or paragraph count, with optional contextual anchoring across a chunk seam.
* Parallel chunk translation under a shared requests-per-minute ceiling.
* Background pre-translation of the next chapter, and chapter summaries.

**Network**

* DNS over HTTPS and DPI bypass, applied locally.
* Domain forwarding rules and request throttling scoped to plugin traffic so covers, AI and translation are
  not paced by source settings.

**Library**

* Categories, light and dark themes, and scheduled library updates.
* Read-ahead chapter downloads for offline reading.
* Novel-only backup and restore, plus LNReader backup import.
* Reading statistics: session tracking, publication status and storage breakdowns, and a reading heatmap.

## Differences from Tsundoku

Tsundoku is a Mihon fork that added novel support while keeping the manga side intact. Boox Book drops that side entirely:

* The manga page viewer, the native image decoder and the Fresco stack are gone.
* Kotlin extension discovery and the Shizuku extension installer are gone.
* Firebase configuration is gone, and release telemetry is disabled.
* React Native is the plugin runtime only — the reader itself is a native WebView plus Compose.

Everything else stays. The library, categories, themes, backups, downloads, statistics and the whole settings
surface are Tsundoku's, and Boox Book follows upstream rather than diverging from it — this fork is a narrowing,
not a rewrite.

The full list lives in [NEKORI_CHANGELOG.md](./NEKORI_CHANGELOG.md). [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) is Tsundoku's own
release record and is kept identical to upstream so it merges cleanly.

## Contributing

[Code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) · [Contributing guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

This is a personal fork, so issues and pull requests may sit unanswered — I build it for myself first. Bugs that also
affect upstream are better reported to [Tsundoku](https://github.com/tsundoku-otaku/tsundoku) or
[Mihon](https://github.com/mihonapp/mihon), where far more people will see them.

There is no Discord server, and there will not be one.

### Credits

Boox Book exists because of work done elsewhere:

* [Mihon](https://github.com/mihonapp/mihon) and [Tachiyomi](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi) — the app this
  is descended from.
* [Tsundoku](https://github.com/tsundoku-otaku/tsundoku) — the novel support this fork is built on.
* [LNReader](https://github.com/LNReader/lnreader) — the plugin ecosystem that makes this app worth using, and the
  backup format it imports.
